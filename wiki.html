    <h1>The Story of Squegi</h1>
    <p>Squegi was a man whose life was defined by one thing: his obsession with Minecraft. For ten years, he dedicated himself to mastering the game. Unlike many who played casually, Squegi approached it with a singular goal—to be the best.</p>
    <p>From the start, things weren’t easy for him. He wasn’t a natural. While others seemed to pick up the game quickly, Squegi struggled. But rather than give up, he made a commitment to himself: he would become the best player, no matter how long it took.</p>
    <p>Every day, Squegi plugged in his mouse—specifically chosen for the game—and practiced. He focused on mastering techniques like scroll rodding and butterfly clicking, and spent hours refining his gameplay. It wasn’t just a hobby; it was his mission. He devoted over 18,000 hours to improving. The commitment was extreme, but over time, it paid off. Eventually, Squegi reached the peak of his skill.</p>
    <p>Tragically, just as he reached his prime, Squegi’s life was cut short by cancer at the age of 28. It was a devastating loss, not just for his family and friends, but for those who had witnessed his remarkable progress over the years.</p>
    <p>Before his death, Squegi had recorded his click patterns as part of a project with an old friend. After he passed, his data was shared with researchers at Harvard. The scientists used it to analyze his clicking techniques and replicate his gameplay patterns, furthering the understanding of human interaction with technology.</p>
    <p>Though Squegi himself is gone, the data he left behind continues his legacy.</p>
